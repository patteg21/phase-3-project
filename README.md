# phase-3-project

In order to begin activate the enviroment
(Pipenv required C++ and extra installation so I opted for a built-in enviroment manager)
Start the venv
```commandline
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install all the required dependencies with pip

Install libraries and dependencies
```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The purpose of this project is to showcase how Commandline Interface(CLI) Application can interact with a DB
Through the CLI you will be able to delete, find, or add items.
Further commands that are not listed on start are
```
ls -a # gets all authors
ls -b # gets all books 
```

This was done to not crowd the CLI at the start.
Additionally, to exit the program you can use 'x'
